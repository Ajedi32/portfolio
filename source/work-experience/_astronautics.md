As a software engineer working on the process team at Astronautics, I work
to develop and deploy processes and tools to help other employees at the
company work more efficiently.

My main project at Astronautics is developing an internal web application
(built with Ruby on Rails) for tracking employee training records and
skillsets. For about two years I was the sole developer assigned to the
project, while my co-workers assisted by reviewing my code and providing
guidance in response to any technical or architectural questions I had. More
recently, other members of the process team have become more involved with
the project, contributing their own code to the development of new features.

My other responsibilities at Astronautics include (but are not limited to):

- Participating in code reviews of code my co-workers have written for other
  tools
- Providing technical assistance to co-workers in my areas of
  expertise
- Writing documentation for internal and external tools
- Helping to manage deployments and backend infrastructure of existing tools by
  creating "recipes" for the configuration management tool Chef.
